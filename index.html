            <!-- I am delighted to know that College of Technology, a constituent faculty of G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, is organizing SAMANVAY-The Annual Alumni Meet on 15th to 17th September 2022. It has been a unique experiment to establish College of Technology in an Agriculture University and when we look back at the past, one can safely comment that experiment has been successful and was later emulated by many other Agriculture Universities. The college is not restricted to core area of engineering/technology such as challenging areas of Electronics, Computer, IT etc. but has also expanded its domain in other areas of Agriculture, Agri- informatics, etc.

            The college has vigorously on giving its budding talents a new path and attitude in order to make them capable of facing the real world challenges. Hope this magazine proves to create dynamic bond between the college and the alumni.

            The G.B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology has a very rich treasure in their alumni. Our Alumni has excelled in every sphere of life and apart from being responsible citizens they are holding high positions across the globe. The university is proud of its alumni and I wish them and their families a bright, happy and healthy future ahead.

            The Dean of the College, President and General Secretary of PTAA along with the staff members, students, organizers and participating Alumni deserve my heartiest congratulations for this wonderful initiative. I wish that this alumni meet SAMANVAY-2022 brings a new era of joy and enlightenment.</br>
